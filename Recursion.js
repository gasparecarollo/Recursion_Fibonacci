//Recursion

//A function that calls itself is called recursiveFibSequence
//A recursive function call itself to reduce a larger problem into a smaller one until it can be solved.

//A Recursive function must have two properties:
// -A simple base case (or cases) - which is a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer
// -The inductive step - A set of rules that reduce all other cases toward the base case
